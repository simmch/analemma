Tungra is the name of the whole world. Everything and everyone in all of this text lives in tungra.

In the world of Tungra, there are three continents: Primos, the Golden Isle, and Fel Glorado. Primos, a primal land to the west, is the birthplace of life on Tungra, home to various humanoid and animal-like species. Humans, Elves, and Dwarves originated here before migrating to the Golden Isle, seeking to build civilizations away from Primos’ wild nature.

The Golden Isle, settled by these migrants, became a land of advanced city-states. Here, diverse races coexisted, building great ports and temples. Despite no overarching country, the city-states formed pacts and alliances, creating a complex political landscape.

Fel Glorado, separated from its neighbor Norfellia by a river, is a land inhabited by great heroes. This island serves as the home of the Demicy, a place of legendary warriors and the seat of the Prime Diety, Damon. Damon, once a heroic figure, ascended to godhood after defeating Abyssis, the god of chaos, absorbing his power. This victory established Fel Glorado’s significance and Damon’s role as the Prime Diety.

In ancient times, Primos faced chaos incursions from the west. The Primordians, led by the First Sorcerer, constructed a great temple atop the Mountains of Chem to fight back. This temple, connected to the Elemental and Outer Planes, brought aid from otherworldly beings.

Kaos, a land of chaos and destruction, existed alongside these continents. The barrier over Kaos, maintained by the power of Gavriel, kept its malevolence at bay. However, when Gavriels Avatar was challenged and slain by Sethh, the serpent God, the barrier fell, unleashing chaos once again.

This event marked the beginning of the Great Cleansing, a war against the forces of chaos. Damon, leading the fight, ultimately imprisoned Abyssis, turning the chaotic land into Fel Glorado and establishing his reign. Asmodeus, involved in the conspiracy against Gavriel, was punished and locked in an eternal battle in the Nine Hells.

The Serpent Isles, once part of Primos, became home to the Yuan Ti after Sethh’s followers were transformed into snakes. In the present day, Fel Glorado is under a new barrier by Damon.
