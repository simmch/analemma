In the tumultuous waters of Orcs Landing, Captain Two Tusk and his crew, including his son Kevdak, faced a legendary sea monster known as the Kraken's Bane. During the fierce battle, Two Tusk, in a desperate attempt to slay the beast, hurled a javelin imbued with powerful magic. But fate twisted cruelly, and the javelin veered off course in the chaos, striking Kevdak instead, mortally wounding him.

As Kevdak lay dying, Two Tusk's heart shattered. In a frantic bid to save his son, he pulled the mystical Ring of Three Wishes from his fingerâ€”a family heirloom rarely used for its unpredictable nature. With tears blurring his vision, he wished, "By any god that will listen, return my son to the living!"

The skies darkened as the slumbering god Abyssonis heeded the call. Kevdak's breath returned, but his resurrection came with a heavy price. The god's hunger for souls now flowed through Kevdak, binding him to a life of reaping in Abyssonis's name. Two Tusk, grateful yet fearful of the ring's power, vowed to safeguard the remaining wishes, for the ring's caprice had been made starkly clear.
