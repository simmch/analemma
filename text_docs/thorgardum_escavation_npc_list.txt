Drunken Dwarf Monk: Adam Dreddleg-

Adam Dreddleg, a circus carnie turned drunken monk, has a tumultuous background marked by family tragedy and personal reinvention. Born into a cardinal family with a failed ringleader father and a desperate mother, his life took a dark turn when his mother, in an attempt to revive the failing family circus, mutilated him, marketing them as a ‘Peg Leg’ act. This grotesque strategy failed, leading to the sale of the circus to Barnabas, a magician who transformed it into the Big Top. Eventually, Adam found his way to Lootas Bae, where he joined the Triads, leaving his troubled past behind and creating his unique form of monk martial arts.

    
Sea Elf Paladin: Seraphel Nightshade

Seraphel Nightshade, a Sea Elf with infernal heritage, was orphaned at the Temple of the Midnight Veil. There, he discovered the Shadegleam Sword, a sentient weapon connected to the Shadowfell. Upon touching it, Seraphel formed a pact with the sword’s consciousness, known as the Moonweaver. This pact granted him Hexblade abilities and a connection to shadow magic. The Moonweaver, punished by Gavriel and bound to the blade, can influence Seraphel’s emotions, leading to occasional blind rages. Seraphel, now wielding this powerful and dangerous weapon, embarks on a journey to understand and master the powers he has acquired.
