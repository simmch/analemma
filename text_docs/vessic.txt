Vessic's betrayal and exile were pivotal in transforming him from a respected figure to a man consumed by hatred. Initially a great man, Vessic was a master in martial arts, weapons, and the law of the Serpent's Embrace, often educating Lunarion and his cousins. His family admired him greatly. However, the betrayal, which led to his exile, caused him to despise the yuan-ti and seek revenge against the world.

This thirst for vengeance led Vessic to form a pact with Asmodeus, the devil, a decision that had catastrophic consequences. In a grim ritual, Vessic sacrificed his own family, sparing only Lunarion, in exchange for power. This act caused the brutal and cruel death of his family, where they disintegrated by fire and their souls were claimed by Asmodeus's domain. 

Lunarion, witnessing the horror of his family's demise, was shaped by these events. Vessic, now blinded by his own ambition, trained Lunarion in the hope of awakening a power he never had. Lunarion's eventual discovery of the truth about his family, trapped in Asmodeus's realm, and the ongoing sacrifices by the yuan-ti nobles, fueled his desire for revenge. This led him to escape slavery and seek training under Kethend to save his family and avenge their deaths.
