I am Lunarion, a pureblood Yuan-ti, born into a lineage stained with betrayal and blood. My grandfather, Vessic, once revered as the head of the largest Yuan-ti faction in Serpent’s Embrace, dared to dream of peace with other races. This vision, however, seeded a venomous hatred among the other house leaders, who then orchestrated a sinister plot. They brutally murdered innocent Yuan-ti children, casting the blame upon Vessic. The ensuing outrage exiled Vessic and his lineage to the forsaken edges of the world, abandoned by allies and stripped of power.

Consumed by a dark maelstrom of hate and malice, Vessic’s soul twisted into a shadow of its former self. Renouncing the Yuan-ti deity Sseth for his perceived weakness, Vessic sought a terrifying new source of power. He turned to the devil Asmodeus, whose whispers promised unimaginable strength in exchange for a horrific price: the hearts of Vessic’s eleven grandchildren.

In a ghastly ritual shrouded in secrecy, Vessic sacrificed my siblings, sparing me only by the whims of fate. Upon my return from a hunt with my father, Hisskar, I witnessed the appalling scene: Vessic, bargaining with Asmodeus to transfer this cursed power onto me. In a chilling act of desperation, Vessic offered the souls of our entire village. My parents disintegrated before my eyes, leaving only Vessic and myself, void of any newfound power.

For three harrowing years, Vessic, blinded by pride, trained me in the arts of our people, awaiting the emergence of a power I did not possess. At the age of eleven, deemed a failure and a disappointment, I was sold into slavery by Vessic to sustain his wretched existence.

Nine years shackled in captivity eroded my Yuan-ti heritage, my faith, and my very self. Yet, in that abyss of despair, Hala’s love was my lone beacon of light. Our clandestine wedding, a brief respite in a life of misery, was shattered when a guard’s spear, intended for my heart, impaled Hala instead. Her life ebbed away, igniting the latent, cataclysmic power within me, a sinister fulfillment of Asmodeus’s dark pact.

Asmodeus materialized, his sinister applause echoing in the cold air, reveling in the gruesome twist of fate. He revealed a chilling truth: the other Yuan-ti house nobles, long envious of Vessic’s power, had been secretly sacrificing children in macabre rituals, trying in vain to summon Asmodeus to aid in their wars against other races. Despite their relentless offerings, the devil seldom heeded their call. Yet, they planned to persist in this blood-stained path, craving the power it promised.

My family, Asmodeus divulged, was not lost to the void but trapped within the infernal confines of the Ninth Hell. With Hala’s death and this revelation, my quest for vengeance against the corrupt nobles of Zaltys, Shirvani, Corthyn, and Rassys took on a new, fervent purpose.

Escaping the slave camp, I sought out Hala’s father, Kethend, a warlock harboring his own bitterness towards the Yuan-ti houses of Zaltys, Shirvani, Corthyn, and Rassys. Under Kethend’s tutelage, and that of his wife, I honed my warlock and sorcerer skills, fueled by a burning desire for retribution and the salvation of my family, lost in the infernal depths of Asmodeus’s domain.

Serpents Embrace House Leaders #dnd #lunarion

House Zaltys: Dominating the populace of Serpent’s Embrace, House Zaltys is renowned for its military prowess and mastery in weaponry and traversal. They are the sinew and backbone of the city’s defenses, their warriors honed to lethal precision. The Zaltys’ influence is widespread, their presence felt in every corner of the land.

House Shirvani: Enigmatic and dwindling, House Shirvani excels in the arcane arts of medicines and poisons. Cloaked in mystery and oddity, they are the least populous, their numbers dwindling due to tragic experiments with poisons that decimated their womenfolk. The house, veiled in secrecy, dwells at the heart of Serpent’s Embrace, opening its doors only to those seeking their unique, often dangerous treatments.

House Corthyn: Masters of duplicity, House Corthyn presents a facade of religious devotion. Secretly, they forgo prayers to Sseth, instead whispering dark pacts to devils. Deep-seated hatred for other races pulsates through their veins, and they spearheaded the plot against Vessic. Publicly lauded for their kindness, they control the city’s education, while privately, they fester with corruption and toxicity.

House Rassys: The diplomats and traders, House Rassys are the communicative link to other races. Beneath this veneer, they engage in the illicit trade of medicines, poisons, and even lives. This house thrives on the shadows of the market, their dealings as serpentine as their heritage.

House Vessic: Historically known as the Serpent’s House, wields significant influence in Serpent’s Embrace, a status bestowed by the deity Sseth 500 years ago. This house is a jack-of-all-trades, excelling in Serpent’s Embrace law, martial arts, combat, and hunting. Members often join the military ranks of House Zaltys. Once tyrannical, House Vessic’s recent generations, including Lunarion’s grandfather Vessic, have shifted towards peace and cooperation with other races, aiming to advance the world through technological and agricultural collaboration.
