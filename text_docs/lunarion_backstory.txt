All About Lunarion

I am Lunarion, a pureblood Yuan-ti, born into a lineage stained with betrayal and blood. My grandfather, Vessic, once revered as the head of the largest Yuan-ti faction in Serpent’s Embrace, dared to dream of peace with other races. This vision, however, seeded a venomous hatred among the other house leaders, who then orchestrated a sinister plot. They brutally murdered innocent Yuan-ti children, casting the blame upon Vessic. The ensuing outrage exiled Vessic and his lineage to the forsaken edges of the world, abandoned by allies and stripped of power.

Consumed by a dark maelstrom of hate and malice, Vessic’s soul twisted into a shadow of its former self. Renouncing the Yuan-ti deity Sseth for his perceived weakness, Vessic sought a terrifying new source of power. He turned to the devil Asmodeus, whose whispers promised unimaginable strength in exchange for a horrific price: the hearts of Vessic’s eleven grandchildren.

In a ghastly ritual shrouded in secrecy, Vessic sacrificed my siblings, sparing me only by the whims of fate. Upon my return from a hunt with my father, Hisskar, I witnessed the appalling scene: Vessic, bargaining with Asmodeus to transfer this cursed power onto me. In a chilling act of desperation, Vessic offered the souls of our entire village. My parents disintegrated before my eyes, leaving only Vessic and myself, void of any newfound power.

For three harrowing years, Vessic, blinded by pride, trained me in the arts of our people, awaiting the emergence of a power I did not possess. At the age of eleven, deemed a failure and a disappointment, I was sold into slavery by Vessic to sustain his wretched existence.

Nine years shackled in captivity eroded my Yuan-ti heritage, my faith, and my very self. Yet, in that abyss of despair, Hala’s love was my lone beacon of light. Our clandestine wedding, a brief respite in a life of misery, was shattered when a guard’s spear, intended for my heart, impaled Hala instead. Her life ebbed away, igniting the latent, cataclysmic power within me, a sinister fulfillment of Asmodeus’s dark pact.

Asmodeus materialized, his sinister applause echoing in the cold air, reveling in the gruesome twist of fate. He revealed a chilling truth: the other Yuan-ti house nobles, long envious of Vessic’s power, had been secretly sacrificing children in macabre rituals, trying in vain to summon Asmodeus to aid in their wars against other races. Despite their relentless offerings, the devil seldom heeded their call. Yet, they planned to persist in this blood-stained path, craving the power it promised.

My family, Asmodeus divulged, was not lost to the void but trapped within the infernal confines of the Ninth Hell. With Hala’s death and this revelation, my quest for vengeance against the corrupt nobles of Zaltys, Shirvani, Corthyn, and Rassys took on a new, fervent purpose.

Escaping the slave camp, I sought out Hala’s father, Kethend, a warlock harboring his own bitterness towards the Yuan-ti houses of Zaltys, Shirvani, Corthyn, and Rassys. Under Kethend’s tutelage, and that of his wife, I honed my warlock and sorcerer skills, fueled by a burning desire for retribution and the salvation of my family, lost in the infernal depths of Asmodeus’s domain.

LUNARIONS GOALS
Lunarion’s Goals
What fuel’s Lunarion?

Lunarion is fueled by a complex blend of motivations:

	1.	Vengeance: The brutal betrayal and loss he experienced, especially the murder of his family and Hala’s tragic death, ignite a deep desire for retribution against those responsible, particularly the corrupt Yuan-ti nobles.
	2.	Justice: Beyond personal revenge, Lunarion seeks to right the wrongs done to his family and to expose the corruption and evil deeds of the noble houses, especially the deceit of House Corthyn.
	3.	Power: Gaining strength both as a warlock under Kethend’s guidance, Lunarion seeks the power necessary to confront and defeat his enemies.
	4.	Family Redemption: Aiming to salvage the honor of House Vessic, once a noble and respected lineage, and to fulfill his grandfather Vessic’s initial vision of peace and collaboration.
	5.	Spiritual Resolve: Despite the horrors he’s witnessed and endured, Lunarion’s journey is also one of internal struggle and growth, balancing the dark influences of his past with his own personal code of ethics and morality.

Lunarion’s character is a tapestry woven from these driving forces, making him a complex and compelling figure in your narrative.

ENCOUNTERS
During the encounter in the dwarves caves where our party was attempting escape, we ended up having to fight a yuan-ti assassin, Varok, and Ssarik.

After dealing the final blow to Ssarik with Amadeus hex, I transformed into a giant serpentine abomination, looking similarly to Ssarik, and he was out of control. It appears Asmodeus had somehow taken control of my body and nearly my mind as well.

In pleading with asmodeus to let his grip go, asmodeus offered a pact. This pact would allow asmodeus to take over my body at will until those he requested I kill are dead. He “promised” not to hurt my friends while in possession of my body, but that can not be trusted. To force me to take the pact he approached and nearly killed Aero. 

I agreed to the pact to protect my comrades. Asmodeus has taken another thing from me. I will not let him take anything else.

Lunarion's Younger Years -

Lunarion's early years were marked by a lack of innate talent, in contrast to his cousins who each excelled in specific areas. However, his determination and hard work led him to excel in various fields such as martial arts, law, history, and school lessons, where he often stayed late to further his knowledge in subjects that intrigued him. Known for his humor and fun-loving nature, Lunarion was popular among peers for his quick wit and slightly rebellious attitude. This popularity extended across children from various houses in Serpent's Embrace.

Lunarion also had a mischievous side, often indulging in pranks. A memorable incident involved him impersonating a teacher, leading to a humorous mix-up. Despite his playful nature and occasional troublemaking, his demeanor remained cheerful.

Aware of the corruption within the houses of Serpent's Embrace, Lunarion often spoke out against it, although his concerns were typically disregarded in a society that valued order and control. His family life was rich and engaging; he frequently joined his father, Hisskar, on hunting trips and spent time reading with his mother, Luna, a law associate from House Vessic but originally from House Corthyn. The union of his parents, a cross-marriage frowned upon in their society, was a source of pride for Lunarion. He often found himself defending their honor against other Yuan-ti teenagers, which led to the scar on his left eye.

Lunarion deeply admired his grandfather's ideals and shared his vision for peace among the Yuan-ti and between the races. His upbringing, experiences, and the values instilled by his family played a crucial role in shaping his beliefs and character.

Lunarion’s Journey

Session 1:
Post-escape from slavery, Lunarion, now on a vengeful quest against the Serpent's Embrace house leaders, is constantly pursued by Yuan-ti assassins. These encounters have sharpened his warlock abilities, particularly his mastery of the Eldritch Blast, and have hardened his heart, intensifying his resolve for retribution. During his journey through the woods, Lunarion encounters Aero and No Beard Gog, who he instinctively trusts are not foes. His patience worn thin and embittered by his past, Lunarion is a stark contrast to his former self. 

Asmodeus appears, taunting Lunarion and demanding the deaths of three individuals, including Vessic and Kethend. This encounter fills Lunarion with seething rage towards Asmodeus. A mysterious ring, a symbol of their dark pact, appears on Lunarion's finger, its removal impossible. Aero and Gog, unaware of Asmodeus's identity, join Lunarion's camp, where they face and defeat Yuan-ti assassins, with Aero narrowly escaping death. This incident starts to soften Lunarion's solitary nature, as he begrudgingly begins to appreciate their company.

Session 2:
Feeling indebted to Aero, Lunarion agrees to rescue him from The Whispers, a group of changelings. In the caves, Lunarion and Gog's partnership strengthens, with Lunarion teaching Gog about tremor lines and night vision. Their journey is marked by battles against skeletons and changelings, where Lunarion begins to respect Gog's combat skills but is frustrated by his reluctance to kill. A critical moment arrives when they force a changeling to reveal Aero's location, only to be betrayed. Lunarion, driven by a mix of camaraderie and vengeance, executes the changeling.

Session 3:
Navigating further, they encounter a room of changelings, agreeing to meet their leader, Varok. Lunarion, simmering with anger, reluctantly follows this plan. A turn of events allows them to rescue Aero and escape through a secret path, avoiding a confrontation with Ssarik from House Zaltys. Despite escaping, Lunarion is infuriated at missing a chance to confront Ssarik. This encounter, however, reinforces his resolve and understanding of the power he seeks.

Session 4:
In the dwarven caves, Asmodeus's sudden appearance and offer of a deal is vehemently rejected by a now powerful and defiant Lunarion. A subsequent battle against Ssarik and Varok ensues, showcasing Lunarion's growing might and strategic prowess. However, Asmodeus seizes control of Lunarion's body, transforming him into a monstrous Yuan-ti. A reluctant pact with Asmodeus restores Lunarion's control, but at a great cost. Lunarion's resolve is now twofold: to achieve his revenge and to rid himself of Asmodeus's manipulation. His only trusted companion remains Gog, as he cautiously navigates his newfound powers and the dangerous path ahead.

This narrative emphasizes Lunarion's transformation from a solitary, vengeful soul to someone who begins to value companionship, all while wrestling with his inner demons and the looming shadow of Asmodeus. His journey is a tumultuous blend of emotional turmoil, strategic battles, and a relentless pursuit of revenge against those who wronged him and his family.
