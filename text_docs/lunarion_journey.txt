Session 1:
Since his escape from the slave camps, and briefly after leaving Kethend’s home to embark on his quest for power to Bring retribution to the house leaders in Serpents Embrace, Lunarion has been hunted by Yuan-ti Assassins as an escapee. Lunarion has had to kill many of his own kind. This has made lunarion more skillful with his warlock abilities, particularly eldritch blast which was the first spell he learned, but how to be more of a tactician in battle weaving spells. This has also made Lunarion harden his heart and steel his resolve toward his goal. Lunarion had been tracked for sometime and found himself in the woods, where he was approached by two people named Aero and No Beard Gog, or just Gog for short. Evidently, Gog had met Aero in the wilderness around the same time. Lunarion did not think much of these two at the time, but he felt keenly that they were not enemies. At this point in Lunarion’s life he has very little patience. Lunarion is quick tempered and a shadow of his former self before slavery. Lunarion has become much harder as a person, his heart much colder. Just as quickly as he met Aero and Gog, Asmodeus revealed himself to Lunarion in the woods. Asmodeus has taking a liking to taunting Lunarion hates this but understands there is little he can do to prevent Asmodeus from doing what he wants, though he plots to kill Asmodeus as soon as he sees him. Asmodeus tells Lunarion that to complete the pact Lunarion must kill 3 individuals. Asmodeus tells Lunarion must kill Vessic, Kethend, and one other individual that Lunarion quickly forgets. This makes Lunarion is emotional, full of rage and hate for asmodeus, more than ever before. Asmodeus then vanishes but not before a darkness engulfs Lunarion’s arm, seeping into a ring that had spawned on Lunarion’s finger, a ring he tried to take off but to no avail. Lunarion does not reveal who Asmodeus was to him to Aero or Gog, but he does make camp with Aero and Gog. That night, Lunarion spoke briefly to Aero and Gog to learn a bit about them. That night, yuan-ti assassins show up and Lunarion was able to kill 2 of them using magic and the weapon that spawned from Lunarion’s ring that Asmodeus bestowed upon him before aero was seemingly killed. Lunarion had been annoyed that Gog was hesitant to kill, and cared little for the death of Aero at the time. But, Aero was seemingly revived. The whole thing with Aero’s supposed death was a blur to Lunarion as he was just happy to survive another night. Lunarion was grateful to Aero and Gog for their assistance, though he did not speak this aloud. Lunarion, Gog, and Aero fled that area and made camp elsewhere. Lunarion spoke to Aero about his family that night and learned a lot about him. Lunarion began to slightly enjoy Aero and Gog’s company. Lunarion had been alone for quite some time up until that point. That night Lunarion Gog and Aero took turns taking watching over camp that night with lunation going first. Lunarion saw nothing during his watch. Next was Gog. Gog saw shadows of his master but it turned out to be nothing after awaking lunarion to help him look. Last was Aero, who disappeared. Aero’s dog came back to the camp barking loudly, waking lunarion and Gog. Lunarion and Gog went to find Aero and stumbled across a changling who was posing as Aero. Lunarion killed him where he stood after asking repeatedly where aero was. Gog found a letter on the changling that discussed a group of changelings kidnapping aero. They were The Whispers. The Whispers kidnapped aero. 

Session 2:
Lunarion feels like he owes Aero for aiding him against assassins the previous night, and more combat would make him more powerful, so he is willing to try to save aero. Gog is also willing to save Aero. Lunarion and Gog follows Zephyr, Aero’s dog that is chasing Aero’s scent, to a cave. Lunarion tells Gog that he will do his best to be patient and nicer to Gog. Lunarion and Gog enters into the cave. Gog is starting to see tremor lines on the ground, to which Lunarion helps him understand that those are his senses being hightened and that this is how he would be able to see in the dark. Lunarion could already see in the dark and he was familiar with tremor lines and senses from lessons in school, albeit he is not too familiar on Monk abilities. Gog is a monk. Lunarion and Gog proceed through the cave and come to a well lit area where there is a large door, or gate, some entrance to a well lit place in the caves. Zephyr is barking to enter. Lunarion and Gog enter into the cave. There were two skeletons in the cave. Lunarion and Gog both kill a skeleton. At this point Lunarion is starting to recognize how powerful Gog is as a monk and respects his skill in battle, he just wishes Gog was more open to killing his opponents rather than showing mercy. As they continue navigating the cave system Lunarion and Gog come across a door where they hear people talking. Lunarion is losing all patience and wants to burst through the door and force the individuals in the room to tell him where Aero is but instead Gog convinces lunarion that he can go in and use words to get that information. Gog’s plan quickly fails and lunarion is forced to go in and save him. Lunarion kills one of the two changelings in the room and forces the other to chop his fingers off for trying to hurt Gog. Lunarion views Gog as a comrade at this point and hates anyone who does him wrong. Lunarion forces the changling to point to where aero is on a map, to which he does. Lunarion then kills the changling to prevent him from bringing other changelings to attack lunarion and gog. Lunarion and Gog also kill a false treasure chest, and two other skeletons around this time. 

Session 3:
Lunarion and Gog are finding their way through the caves system toward the space where the changing pointed aero was. On the way, lunarion and gog stumbled across a room. Lunarion and Gog heard numerous voices in the room and opted to again try with words rather than violence, albeit Lunarion was more than willing to attack to kill upon entry. Lunarion and Gog enter and have a discussion with the changlings in the room. The changelings agreed to take lunarion and Gog to their leader, Varok, per the request of Gog. This pissed Lunarion off and lunarion was ready to kill everyone in the room, but on the way to Varok there were more and more Changling Whispers so a fight would have been futile. Lunarion and Gog were led to Varoks thronerooum, where varok was noticeably disgusted by Lunarion’s appearance. Lunarion thought nothing of it but assumed Varok must have had a bad experience with Yuan-ti in the past. A discussion ensued. Lunarion and Gog told Varok they were merely looking for a way out of the cave system to save their fake family on the other side of the cave. They did not mention Aero. Before Varok can do anything to Luanrion or Gog, a changing came to Varok, Varok is a Whisper General and Aero’s uncle, the changing told Varok that their mortal enemy had showed up in the cave system to kill them. This enemy was Ssarik. Ssarik was there to kill Varok due to Varok killing his brother. Lunarion and Gog was able to flee to a secret room where Zephyr found Aero! Lunarion and Gog had saved Aero! The group proceeded to flee through the secret path in the back through a dark passage and made it out in a deeper depths of these dwarves caves. Boggrin and Amnus had came through a portal around this time in the Dwarven caves. At this time, Lunarion was highly upset at the fact that he fled from Ssarik and did not kill him, as he knew Ssarik was from house Zaltys. Lunarion and Gog had fell in some water while carrying Aero and in that moment Lunarion washed his anguish away and recognized that Ssarik's display of power was what he needed to see to know how to get to the next level in strength. Lunarion’s resolve was no longer wavered and he felt strength coursing through his veins. Little did lunarion know, he would get his chance to kill Ssarik sooner than expected. Lunarion Aero and Gog met up with Amnus and Boggrin unexpectedly at an intersection while attacking a changling Whisper spy. Lunarion was so excited to kill this changling, as his blood thirst was at an all time high. Lunarion screamed at Amnus to leave the changling and allow lunarion to kill it. Amnus abridged. The changling tried to kill itself by stabbing itself over and over to prevent lunarion from killing him, this was due to lunarion’s ring radiating lunarion’s killing intent and causing fear to fall upon the changling. Lunarion approached, spoke death to Asmodeus and his enemies, and crushed the changling’s neck speparating its head from its body. Due to being struck to death by Lunarion’s weapon that spawned from his ring, the changling was covered in pitch black essence that came off of lunarion’s weapon and by the time the black essence came back to lunarion’s hand the changling was gone completely. The ring had sent the changling to hell directly, to Asmodeus lair. As lunarion gets strong, so does Asmodeus. Lunarion softly hissed in satisfaction at his latest kill, resolve steeled. 

Session 4:
Lunarion and Gog are in a race to escape the dwarven caves while Amnus and Boggrin are taking their time, as they had just arrived. Amnus and Boggrin were unaware of how dire the situation was and that was causing lunarion to be angry toward them but he appreciated how understanding Boggrin was in such a short amount of time. Lunarion didn’t care much for whatever apparitions and such coming up talking to the party about the dwarves caves, he only wants to leave the caves to continue on his journey. The party of lunarion aero Gog Boggrin and Amnus stumbled across a bunch of treasure. Asmodeus revealed himself to the group out of nowhere suddenly and asked if anyone wanted to make a deal. Lunarion was screaming and yelling in anger and conceit in a way because of how strong he felt, cautioning everyone to ignore asmodeus. Asmodeus made statements about foreseeing something in the near future but lunarion didn’t care to heed his warning. Asmodeus left. The party searched the treasure. Lunarion began to sense other yuan-ti around, pushing his anxiety and desire to escape, telling the others they need to flee as he had no idea the number of enemies that could come. Lunarion found a bag and threw it into lava as he didn’t care for the treasure, to which aero went to fetch as he had insterest in it. Once aero made it to the bag near a wall the wall burst open with Ssarik and Varok falling from the wall down the water way in battle!! Lunarion instantly felt a rush of excitement at this second opportunity for battle! Lunarion yelled to the party that they were to stand and fight! Lunarion knew that Varok and Ssarik had been fighting all this time and they both must be tired, and he wanted to use this opportunity to destroy them both and get stronger! The fight broke out, and the party began weaving spells, arrows, and more attacks at the two monsters. Lunarion noticed them in the water, so he used electric spells to incapacitate them and deal large amounts of damage. Aero struck them with many errors damaging them badly. In the end, Lunarion’s Hex exploded with dark energy inside of Ssarik killing him. Lunarion killed Ssarik. But, then the worst happened. Lunarion began transforming into a large abomination yuan-ti monster! Asmodeus had taken over Lunarion’s body and refused to give it back until lunarion agreed to a pact rule that allows Asmodeus to take over lunarion’s body, or at least to attempt to, at will. Lunarion begged Asmodeus to leave, even as Asmodeus tried to trick lunarion by transforming into Hisskar, lunarion’s father, to convince him to take the pact. Lunarion ultimately agreed to the pact to prevent Asmodeus from killing Aero and the other’s there. Lunarion regained his senses, but he knew if he needed to in a dire situation he felt the power to transform into that abomination at will but at the risk of Asmodeus taking full control. Lunarion could not use this new found power unwisely. Lunarion also knew that the power in his ring could create any weapon, and upon killing an enemy with this weapon they will be sent straight to hell, Asmodeus’s domain. Lunarion is frustrated. Lunarion is in great pain. Lunarion must continue his mission, but he is not wary of building relationships with other. At this time the only companion he views as a friend if Gog, the companion he spent most of his time with. Lunarion is strong and confident, but concerned about those around him. Lunarion will complete his goal for vengance with his own hand, and his own strength. He does not need help from Asmodeus. Lunarion wants to kill Asmodeus now more than ever.
