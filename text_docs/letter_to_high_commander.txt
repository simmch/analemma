To High Commander Aerys

Subject: Critical Update on Wolfcub and Yuan Ti Encounter

High Commander Aerys,

With urgency and concern, I report to you the latest developments in our covert operations under Project Wolfcub and our recent encounters with the Yuan Ti.

Our operative Lara successfully infiltrated a Yuan Ti regiment, only to uncover a significant force led by Ssarik in the vicinity of Aero's last known location. Her mission was compromised, leading to a confrontation with the Yuan Ti. Fortunately, Lara managed to escape, thanks to the intervention of an unidentified eldritch entity, which resulted in the death of several Yuan Ti combatants.

Our primary mission to retrieve Aero took a dire turn. Upon arrival at his cave, we discovered a tragic scene. Deep Cover Silence Agents Wuanshu and Agent Orphea were found deceased, their bodies in wolf forms, indicating that Project Wolfcub has been compromised and failed in its objective.

After an exhaustive search, we located Aero and transported him to the safety of Thorgardum's ruins. We have been in hiding for several days, constantly under the threat of the Yuan Ti forces surrounding us.

Given the gravity of our situation and the strategic importance of our mission, I am requesting immediate assistance. I urge you to deploy the Shadow Guard to launch a decisive strike against the Yuan Ti incursion in Primos, particularly in the area known as Serpent's Embrace. Their intervention is crucial to secure our position and ensure the success of our ongoing operations.

Your prompt response is critical. The safety of Aero and the success of our mission depend on the swift action of the Shadow Guard.

Awaiting your orders,

Varok
