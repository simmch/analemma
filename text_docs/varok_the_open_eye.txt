Varok's Story

Letter to Varok
[Letter Enclosed in an Envelope Bearing the Seal of The Whispers]

[Inner Seal: The Seal of The Silence]

Date: 20 Years Ago

To Varok, Commander of the Vanguard Force

Varok,

As I pen this letter, a matter of grave urgency and absolute secrecy confronts us. It concerns my son, Aero, whose existence must remain concealed from prying eyes, especially those within the ranks of the High Intercessor.

Twenty years have passed since Aero was clandestinely removed from Fel Glorado to shield him from a fate intertwined with dark prophecies. The time has now come for his return. The High Intercessor’s demands grow more voracious, and Aero’s role in our plans has become pivotal.

Your mission, Varok, is of the highest confidentiality. Locate Aero and bring him back to Fel Glorado. This task is entrusted to you and your newly appointed unit, the Vanguard Force. This black ops division, operating under the aegis of The Eyes of Aerys, will serve as my personal guard and execute missions requiring utmost discretion.

Remember, this mission must remain a secret, known only to your most trusted within The Silence. The implications of Aero’s lineage are far-reaching and could jeopardize our position if revealed prematurely.

Upon completion of your reading, destroy this letter immediately. Leave no trace of this communication. The safety of Aero and the balance of power within Fel Glorado depend on your unwavering discretion and decisive action.

In service of the shadows,

High Commander Aerys

P.S. The weight of this responsibility is immense, but I trust in your loyalty and capability. Success in this mission will not only secure our cause but also shape the future of Fel Glorado.

Varok's Backstory
Varok's journey to becoming the Captain of the Whispers' Infiltration Regiment is a tale of ambition, guilt, and relentless pursuit of redemption. Born into a lineage known for their exceptional skills in espionage, Varok was raised in an environment where mastering the art of deception was not just a skill, but a way of life. From a young age, he showed a natural aptitude for this craft, quickly outshining his peers in the complex arts of disguise and intelligence gathering.

The defining moment of his early career, however, was marked by both triumph and tragedy. During a critical mission to infiltrate the Yuan Ti society, a task spearheaded by his brother, the then-Captain of the Vanguard Company, Varok played a key role. This mission was crucial for gathering intelligence that would give The Whispers a significant advantage in their ongoing covert operations.

Unfortunately, the mission was fraught with unforeseen challenges. A series of miscalculations, partly attributed to Varok's overconfidence, led to their exposure. In the ensuing skirmish on the Serpent Isles, Varok's brother was killed by Ssarik, a formidable member of House Zaltys. This event had a profound impact on Varok, leaving him with a deep sense of guilt and embarrassment. The loss of his brother not only was a personal tragedy but also served as a stain on his professional reputation, something he felt he could never fully rectify.

Despite this setback, Varok's skills and determination saw him rise through the ranks, eventually attaining the position of Captain himself. However, the shadow of that fateful mission never left him. He constantly felt overshadowed by the legacy of his late brother, believing that no matter his achievements, he could never truly make amends for his past mistakes.

His relationship with Ssarik turned deeply personal. Varok harbored a burning hatred for Ssarik, seeing him not only as a sworn enemy of The Whispers but also as a living reminder of his greatest failure. This animosity was further fueled by Ssarik's relentless pursuit of revenge for the death of his own brother and friend during the incident.

Varok, now known as "The Open Eye," continues to lead The Whispers with a mix of brilliant strategy and a relentless drive to prove himself, all the while haunted by the ghosts of his past and the unending quest for redemption in a world of shadows and deception.

Varok was killed by Aero, his nephew. Varok was not killed by Ssarik.
