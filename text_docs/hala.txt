Hala, Lunarion's wife, was a significant figure in his life, embodying hope and resilience despite the harsh realities of slavery. Born into a family of magic users in Serpent's Embrace, with her father Kethend being a warlock and her mother Vanessa a sorcerer, Hala had a comfortable upbringing. However, her life took a tragic turn when she was sold into slavery by slave traders from House Rassys.

Hala's knowledge of magic was limited, insufficient to be a threat or a means of escape. Her familiarity with House Vessic, being from Serpent's Embrace, played a role in her understanding of the political and social dynamics of the yuan-ti society. Despite her circumstances, Hala maintained a calm and patient demeanor, which eventually drew Lunarion towards her.

Their relationship began when Lunarion protected Hala during a failed escape attempt by other slaves. This act of integrity, where Lunarion suffered a severe beating while trying to shield Hala from guards' accusations, earned her admiration and respect. Over the years, their bond deepened, with Lunarion finding solace in Hala's presence. She became his beacon of hope, a source of calmness and understanding amidst the chaos of their enslaved lives.

Hala's personality was multifaceted; she was not only patient and understanding but also possessed a sense of humor and culinary skills that were highly regarded even by the slave traders. Occasionally, she cooked for their guests, showcasing her exceptional talent in the kitchen.

However, Hala's tragic death marked a turning point for Lunarion. Her demise, while catalyzing the awakening of his latent powers, left a void in his life that no amount of newfound power could fill. Hala's influence on Lunarion was profound; she was not just a wife but a symbol of what he had lost and the person who shaped his path towards freedom and vengeance. Her death broke him but also unleashed his abilities, setting him on a path of retribution fueled by the memory of her love and the injustice they endured.
