Serpents Embrace House Leaders #dnd #lunarion

House Zaltys: Dominating the populace of Serpent’s Embrace, House Zaltys is renowned for its military prowess and mastery in weaponry and traversal. They are the sinew and backbone of the city’s defenses, their warriors honed to lethal precision. The Zaltys’ influence is widespread, their presence felt in every corner of the land.

House Shirvani: Enigmatic and dwindling, House Shirvani excels in the arcane arts of medicines and poisons. Cloaked in mystery and oddity, they are the least populous, their numbers dwindling due to tragic experiments with poisons that decimated their womenfolk. The house, veiled in secrecy, dwells at the heart of Serpent’s Embrace, opening its doors only to those seeking their unique, often dangerous treatments.

House Corthyn: Masters of duplicity, House Corthyn presents a facade of religious devotion. Secretly, they forgo prayers to Sseth, instead whispering dark pacts to devils. Deep-seated hatred for other races pulsates through their veins, and they spearheaded the plot against Vessic. Publicly lauded for their kindness, they control the city’s education, while privately, they fester with corruption and toxicity.

House Rassys: The diplomats and traders, House Rassys are the communicative link to other races. Beneath this veneer, they engage in the illicit trade of medicines, poisons, and even lives. This house thrives on the shadows of the market, their dealings as serpentine as their heritage.

House Vessic: Historically known as the Serpent’s House, wields significant influence in Serpent’s Embrace, a status bestowed by the deity Sseth 500 years ago. This house is a jack-of-all-trades, excelling in Serpent’s Embrace law, martial arts, combat, and hunting. Members often join the military ranks of House Zaltys. Once tyrannical, House Vessic’s recent generations, including Lunarion’s grandfather Vessic, have shifted towards peace and cooperation with other races, aiming to advance the world through technological and agricultural collaboration.

This is the ritual conducted by the people of Serpents Embrace that decide who will rule for the next 1000 years


Every 1,000 years, Serpent’s Embrace undergoes a profound and transformative event: the Serpent House Ritual. This sacred and daunting ceremony determines the ruling house for the next millennium. For 30 consecutive days and nights, the people engage in relentless prayer to Sseth, enduring extreme fasting and personal sacrifice. The ritual reaches its zenith with the sacrifice of 30 chosen individuals - men, women, or children - offered to demonstrate their devotion and submission to Sseth.

In a divine response to these sacrifices, Sseth makes His will known by sparing a single individual from one of the houses. The survival of this person is seen as a direct decree from Sseth, granting their house the divine right to rule over Serpent’s Embrace for the next thousand years. This ritual intertwines faith, power, and survival in a display that is as awe-inspiring as it is terrifying, encapsulating the fierce devotion and complex hierarchy that defines Serpent’s Embrace.
