Names for the Archaeologist Party and FOB:

Dwarven Archaeologist Party:

    
Lead Archaeologists : Baelin Gearforge

Baelin Gearforge, a brave young dwarven female archaeologist from Durinforge, has a remarkable story of resilience and ingenuity. After a harrowing solo expedition near Lootas Bae in search of a rumored Ten Ring beneath Harborwatch, Baelin tragically lost portions of both her legs. Displaying incredible strength, she survived by self-amputating and crawling to safety, where the Triad eventually rescued her. Now bound to a wheelchair, she continues her work in Thorgardum, where she has ingeniously created a Siphon powered  piece of artificer technology, utilizing scrap found at the Thorgardums expedition site. Her spirit and intellect remain unbroken, driving her to continue her pursuit of ancient relics and knowledge.

    
Lead Researcher: Thora Stonereader

Thora Stonereader, harboring unrequited feelings for Amnus, experienced jealousy when Amnus chose to be with Xia. Raised in a family deeply involved in archaeology, with her mother being a historian and her father a researcher of dwarven catacombs, Thora had a rich background in historical research. Her life took a significant turn when she discovered Baelin Gearforge, who had survived a perilous journey in the catacombs. Recognizing Baelin’s discovery of an ancient siphon and her potential, Thora joined her in an expedition funded by the Triad mercenaries to explore Thorgardum’s ruins, where she served as the Lead Researcher, leveraging her family’s expertise and reputation.

    
Excavation Expert and Slaver: Durnik Ironpick

Durnik Ironpick, once part of the Iron tusk pirates, now operates as a slaver and a dubious “Excavation Expert.” Exiled for his illicit dealings, he manipulates slaves with promises of freedom, pushing them into perilous excavations. His primary clients are House Shirvani, a mysterious group known for their arcane arts in medicine and poison. Situated in Serpent’s Embrace, home to the Yuan Ti, House Shirvani uses slaves for experiments, largely due to their own dwindling numbers. Durnik’s involvement in this operation is driven by his interest in the resurgence of Artificiers’ tools, Chaos engines, and Siphon Crystals. He travels with 3 slavers. 10 slaves at camp and 4 at work when they meet the party. The slaves designated for resale have their tongues cut. Shirvani prefers when his experiments don’t scream. 

Slavers:

    The slavers working with Durnik Ironpick in Thorgardum have diverse and complex backgrounds:

    
Krond Brambletusk: An orc slaver from Orcs Landing, Krond detests the barbarism of his kin. He chose a different path, focusing on the slaving business.
Sylas Blackchain: A former slave himself, Sylas proved his worth with his sailing skills. He still wears his black slave collar, a symbol of his past, and is involved in managing labor slaves.
Vorga Whiphand: A “Cut” slave, Vorga was groomed to be sold to the Yuan Ti. Her draconic lineage made her a candidate for their experiments, but her latent powers never manifested. She now oversees other “Cut” slaves who are being prepared for resale, under Durnik’s command.

Labor Slaves:

        
Jorin Quickfoot: A Harengan, a rabbit-like humanoid, Jorin compensates for having only half a pickaxe with remarkable speed and energy, striking the rocks furiously.
Elara Willowbend: A pacifist human druid, Elara avoids using a pickaxe by transforming into a mole, utilizing her wild shape ability to dig efficiently.
Merek Shadowsneak: A young Shadar-Kai elf, Merek bears a striking resemblance to Leon, a friend of No Beard Gog. Merek’s youth is notable, making him an unlikely and probably unwilling participant in the harsh conditions of the mines.
The stinky one. A small goblin slave. Rejected by the Yuan Ti after already having its tongue cut.
