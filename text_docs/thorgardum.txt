The Fall of Thorgardum, the dwarven king
(Each part of the tale can be discovered inscribed on ancient plaques scattered throughout the ruins.)

Part One: The Hubris of the Deep
(Found at the entrance of the ruins.)

In ages past, beneath the earth, the Dwarves of Thorgardum delved deep,
Their picks and hammers, songs of might, disturbed the ancient stone’s sleep.
King Durin’s gaze, set upon the core, where power and riches lay,
The heart of the mountain throbbed with life, as night turned into day.

Part Two: The Grand Forge's Blaze
(Located near the remnants of the Grand Forge.)

The Grand Forge burned with fervent glow, a testament to Dwarven pride,
Here, steel and gem did marry, beneath the mountain’s stony hide.
Rune-casters’ words, weaved with the flames, called forth the elements’ dance,
In Thorgardum’s halls, avarice grew, with each enchanted lance.

Part Three: The Schism of Stone
(Placed in a collapsed hall, split by a great chasm.)

But not all hearts did yearn for more, the Stonebinders warned of doom,
Urged restraint in magic’s touch, lest it lead to Thorgardum’s tomb.
Yet pride’s whisper, a siren’s call, led kin against their kin,
The schism cracked the unity, as doubt seeped through the din.

Part Four: The Earth's Retaliation
(Found by a destroyed statue of King Durin.)

Then came the night when earth fought back, its rage a force untamed,
The Grand Forge’s heart, once warm and bright, erupted unrestrained.
The elements in chaos clashed, stone and metal rent asunder,
As Thorgardum shook, the deep did roar, a world torn ‘neath the thunder.

Part Five: Thorgardum's Lament
(In the deepest part of the ruins, near a tranquil underground lake.)

Now silent stand the Dwarven halls, where echoes fade to naught,
The pride of old, a memory, in ancient stone enwrought.
Thorgardum’s children, lost to time, their tale a somber chant,
Let history’s voice preserve their name, in Thorgardum’s lament.

(As the party collects the pieces of the tale, the tragedy of Thorgardum unfolds, a somber reminder of the past's reach into the present.)


Thorgardum's Ballad -
Long Version:
(Verse 1)
In the heart of the mountain's embrace,
Thorgardum stood, a paragon of Dwarven grace.
King Durin’s pride, where the anvils sang,
And the deep halls with golden laughter rang.

(Chorus)
Oh, Thorgardum, the mountain’s crown,
Where gems were bright, and hammers sound.
Oh, Thorgardum, your fate we mourn,
In the deep where the world was torn.

(Verse 2)
The Grand Forge's flame kissed the sky,
Under the watch of the ancestors' eye.
Rune-casters' chants, a mystical art,
Binding the elements, they played their part.

(Chorus)
Oh, Thorgardum, the mountain’s crown,
Where magic thrived, below the ground.
Oh, Thorgardum, your glory's shorn,
By the greed that from the heart was born.

(Bridge)
The schism came, like a thief in the night,
Stonebinders warned of the arcane’s plight.
Brothers in arms, now foes in war,
The mountain wept, for peace no more.

(Verse 3)
Then came the fall, as the earth did swallow,
The halls of splendor, hollow, hollow.
A cataclysm of the Dwarves' own making,
The mountain’s heart, forever aching.

(Chorus)
Oh, Thorgardum, the mountain’s crown,
Now laid so low, once so renown.
Oh, Thorgardum, in ruins adorned,
In whispered tales, your memory borne.

(Outro)
In the ruins’ shade, The Whispers tread,
Among the echoes of the noble dead.
But Thorgardum’s secrets, forever keep,
In the mountain’s heart, so vast and deep.

Short Version:
(Chorus)
Oh, Thorgardum, the mountain’s tear,
Once mighty halls, now laid bare.
In the deep, where shadows form,
Lies the legend of Thorgardum.

(Verse)
King Durin’s realm, where forges burned,
Till greed and magic, the tide turned.
The earth did shake, the mountain’s doom,
Thorgardum fell, to silence entombed.

(Chorus)
Oh, Thorgardum, the mountain’s tear,
Songs of the lost, we still hear.
In whispers low, the tale is spun,
Of the rise and fall of Thorgardum.

(Outro)
And still it sleeps, the ancient gloom,
Thorgardum waits, in the deep's womb.
A memory, in the stone's heart,
Of the day the mountain was torn apart.

This song can be sung by bards or passed down in dwarven lore, serving as a poignant reminder of the splendor and tragedy of Thorgardum.
