Yohan backstory:

Yohan, once a proud member of the Moonshadow Pack a peaceful passive pack, witnessed the annihilation of his kin when a human kingdom, fueled by paranoia and prejudice, mercilessly targeted his pack for their lycanthropic nature. The once-thriving pack, known for their unity and wisdom and peaceful ways, crumbled under the weight of an unjust vendetta.

Consumed by grief and burning with a desire for retribution and justice to make sure injustice like this don’t happen to him again, Yohan forsook the remnants of his former life. The intense anguish led him to a warrior path, where he embraced the combative teachings of a deity known for battle and warfare. Devoting himself to this god of battle, Yohan sought the power to avenge his fallen pack and make sure his peacefulness isn’t a weakness anymore.

His once passive heart tainted by anger, Yohan became a formidable force, a werewolf with eyes that glowed with an otherworldly fervor. As he roamed the realms between the human and supernatural, Yohan pursued his singular purpose: to mete out justice in the most merciless fashion. Yet, beneath the rage and bloodlust, a flicker of the peaceful wolf he once was remains, a poignant reminder of the tragedy that transformed him into a creature of a hardened warrior
